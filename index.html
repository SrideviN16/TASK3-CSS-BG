     <p>Copyright is a legal concept, which gives <span>the author or creator of a work legal</span> control over the duplication and public performance of their work. In many jurisdictions, this is limited by a time period after which the works then enter the public domain. Copyright laws are a balance between the rights of creators of intellectual and artistic works and the rights of others to build upon those works. During the time period of copyright the author's work may only be copied, modified, or publicly performed with the consent of the author, unless the use is a fair use. Traditional copyright control limits the use of the work of the author to those who either pay royalties to the author for usage of the author's content or limit their use to fair use. Secondly, it limits the use of content whose author cannot be found.[11] Finally, it creates a perceived barrier between authors by limiting derivative works, 
     such as mashups and collaborative content</p>

      <p>Free and open-source software, which is also often referred to as open source software and free software, is a maturing technology with major companies using free software to provide both services and technology to both end-users and technical consumers. The ease of dissemination has allowed for increased modularity, which allows for smaller groups to contribute to projects as well as simplifying collaboration. Open source development models have been classified as having a similar peer-recognition and collaborative benefit incentives that are typified by more classical fields such as scientific research, with the social structures that result from this incentive model decreasing production cost.[19] Given sufficient interest in a software component, by using peer-to-peer distribution methods, distribution costs of software may be reduced, removing the burden of infrastructure maintenance from developers. As distribution 
	  resources are simultaneously provided by consumers, these software distribution models are scalable, that is the method is feasible regardless of the number of consumers. In some cases, free software vendors may use peer-to-peer technology as a method of dissemination.[20] In general, project hosting and code distribution is not a problem for the most of free projects as a 
	  number of providers offer them these services freeIn media, which includes textual, audio, and visual content, free licensing schemes such as some of the licenses made by Creative Commons have allowed for the dissemination of works under a clear set of legal permissions. Not all Creative Commons licenses are entirely free; their permissions may range from very liberal general redistribution and modification of the work to a more restrictive redistribution-only licensing. Since February 2008, Creative Commons licenses which are entirely free carry a badge indicating that they are "approved for free cultural works".[16] Repositories exist which exclusively feature free material and provide content such as photographs, clip art, music,[17] and literature.[18] While extensive reuse of free content from one website in another website is legal, it is usually not sensible because of the duplicate content problem. Wikipedia is amongst the most well-known databases of user-uploaded 
	  free content on the web. While the vast majority of content on Wikipedia is free content,some copyrighted material is hosted under fair-use criteria.Free content principles have been translated into fields such as engineering, where designs and engineering knowledge can be readily shared and duplicated, in order to reduce overheads associated with project development. Open design principles can be applied in engineering and technological applications, with projects in mobile telephony, small-scale manufacture,[21] the automotive industry,[22][23] and even agricultural areas. Technologies such as distributed manufacturing can allow computer-aided manufacturing and computer-aided design techniques to be able to develop small-scale production of components for the development of new, or repair of existing, devices. Rapid fabrication technologies underpin these developments, which allow end-users of technology to be able to construct devices from pre-existing blueprints, using software and manufacturing hardware to convert information

	 "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,  written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the 
	 theory of   ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
	 comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those 
	 interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de  Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact 
	 original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham
	 Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature
	 from 45 BC,  making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, 
	 looked up one of the more  obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the
	 word in classical literature, discovered the  undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of 
	 "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,  written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the
